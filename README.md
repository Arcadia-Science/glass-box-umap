# From black box to glass box: Making UMAP embeddings interpretable with exact feature contributions

This code repository contains or points to all materials required for creating and hosting the publication entitled, *"From black box to glass box: Making UMAP embeddings interpretable with exact feature contributions"*.

The publication is hosted at [this URL](https://arcadia-science.github.io/glass-box-umap/).

## Data Description

We apply the glass box UMAP approach to feature interpretation to the human bone marrow gene expression data of [A sandbox for prediction and integration of DNA, RNA, and proteins in single cells by Luecken et al. 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE194122), which is included as the example dataset in ScanPy.
