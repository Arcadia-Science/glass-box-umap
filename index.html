<p>UMAP is a widely-used tool for low-dimensional visualization of high-dimensional datasets. UMAP learns a low-dimensional mapping from nearest-neighbor graph structures of datasets, often producing visually interpretable clusters of data that match known labels (e.g., cell type). This is possible because the mapping is highly nonlinear with respect to the input features values, giving it the expressive power needed to form distinct clusters. While the learned relationship between the input features and the embedding positions is often useful, the same nonlinearity that enables clean clusters also makes it difficult to directly interpret the mapping in terms of the input features.</p>
<p>Here, we show how to enable interpretation of the mapping through an alternative implementation of the parametric UMAP algorithm which learns the embedding with a deep network that is locally linear (but globally nonlinear) with respect to the input features. This “glass-box” approach provides a set of exact feature contributions as linear weights that determine the embedding of each data point. By computing the exact feature contribution for each point in a dataset, we can directly quantify which features are responsible for forming each cluster. We explore the feature contributions from this glass-box augmentation of UMAP with several</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">## Introduction</h2>
<p>UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a powerful tool for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Despite some critical appraisals focused on the use of relative distances over the nonlinear embedding space to generate hypotheses, as well as the “black box” nature of the nonlinear mapping, UMAP remains popular in many fields. Here we present an augmentation to conventional UMAP analysis that generates exact feature attributions for each point in the dataset.</p>
<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is another popular was an early linear method for dimensionality reduction which finds an alternative representation of data by determining a set of orthogonal directions of maximal variance.Since the principal components that can be used for dimensionality reduction are the linear weights on input feature, this approach was considered to be directly interpretable in feature space, despite its deficiency in clustering similar classes.</p>
<p>For complex datasets, the clusters learned by PCA are not always distinct. For example, PCA on the classic MNIST dataset of hand-drawn digits produces some distinct clusters, but many overlapping points. UMAP emerged as a nonlinear alternative that, like PCA, operated in an unsupervised fashion but could also learn distinct clusters for complex datasets.</p>
<p>However, this shift to a nonlinear method came at the cost of interpretable embeddings. Nonlinear methods are generally thought to be black boxes, although there are a range of post-hoc feature attribution methods that provide some measure of interpretability (like differential expression applied to selected clusters for scRNAseq data). UMAP is ubiquitous because of its ability to successfully learn and cluster classes for complex datasets in an unsupervised fashion, in spite of its black-box nature.</p>
<p>UMAP generates distinct clusters as a black box, while PCA provides overlapping clusters for complex datasets, but also exact feature contributions. What if we could have the best of both approaches? A technique for interpreting nonlinear deep networks [Wang et al., 2016; Mohan et al., 2019] provides the key for bringing exact feature interpretability to UMAP.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="method">## Method</h2>
<p>At a high level, UMAP emUMAP embeds high-dimensional data into low dimensions by building a nearest-neighbor graph in the original space and learning an embedding in the low-dimensional space that preserves the nearest-neighbor graph according to a loss function.</p>
<p>The extension to a “parametric” form of UMAP (McInnes, 2018 NC), where the low dimensional mapping is learned by a deep network, is a valuable generalization of the embedding approach where new data points can be embedded using the same function,which was not possible with the original version of UMAP. The parametric network is trained using the same loss function (TO DO: show loss function) as the non-parametric model, so this deep network function captures the same relationships as the original non-parametric implementation.</p>
<p>The deep network approach for parametric UMAP is conventionally considered to be somewhat opaque to feature attribution. However, by taking advantage of a growing body of work in this area, we can implement a deep network with a particular architecture that allows us to measure the exact contributions of each input feature.</p>
<p>In the “Extended Data Jacobian Matrix” [Wang et al., 2016] and “Bias-free deep networks…” [Mohan et al., 2019], it is shown that deep networks with zero bias linear layers and certain types of activation functions have exactly equivalent linear representations. Even though these networks are globally nonlinear, which is why deep networks can learn such complex mappings, they are also locally linear for a particular input. These networks fall into the category of homogeneous functions of order 1, which based on Euler’s theorem means they have an equivalent representation:</p>
<p>y(x) = J(x) * x</p>
<p>This is both linear and exact, although the Jacobian must be numerically computed for each input. Linear representations offer a straightforward approach to understanding what the network is doing. At the very least, they are more interpretable than locally nonlinear networks (which includes any deep network with nonzero bias terms in its linear layers).</p>
<p>In today’s GPU rich world, it is straightforward to compute these linear feature contributions for every point in a dataset. These types of deep networks for genomics data are locally linear, and from an interpretability perspective they are effectively globally linear. We easily can perform an exhaustive local analysis, where we compute the Jacobian (via autograd) for every point in a dataset. With globally linear systems, there is only one set of feature weights to analyze, but with locally linear systems, there are as many Jacobians (feature weights) as data points, this becomes an additional step in the analysis.</p>
<p>The exactness of this Jacobian approach is the centerpiece of its appeal. This local analysis is similar to SHAP, LIME and GradCAM, but those are all approximations which could be completely incorrect for the actual nonlinear representation. The Jacobian of a zero-bias ReLU deep network simply weights each feature, quantifying how the globally nonlinear network uses it in the output.</p>
<p>In our case, we apply these deep networks with linear equivalents that exactly reconstruct the output to UMAP. In many papers, UMAP is presented as an interesting representation of data, but is not used much beyond that. In the conventional approach to defining cell type clusters in the embedding space, differential expression is run on various clusters to show what genes are differentially expressed on average (which is a completely different calculation than anything UMAP has done), and cell types are assigned based on those genes. In contrast, with fully interpretable “glass-box” networks, we can compute the exact contribution of each gene to the position of every single cell shown in the UMAP embedding space. Now, the exact gene feature contributions can be directly pulled from the nonlinear UMAP function, instead of from differential expression acting as a proxy for what UMAP learned. Additionally, the Jacobian approach works equally as well for image or protein embedding representations as scRNAseq data, where tools like differential expression are not available.</p>
<p>Beyond the feature attributions for each point, these can be aggregated over categories (like Leiden cluster or cell type) in order to generate hypotheses about the gene features connected to higher-level phenotypes represented in the dataset. This can be done in a straightforward manner by conditioning the feature attribution calculations on a given cell type (or Leiden cluster) and measuring summary statistics, like the mean or the SVD of the feature contributions.</p>
<p>The use of glass box deep networks for UMAP therefore provides clarity into what the embedding function has actually learned.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">## Conclusion</h2>
<p>This work demonstrates a novel approach to interpreting UMAP embeddings by leveraging glass box deep networks. We’ve shown how to overcome the traditional black box nature of nonlinear dimensionality reduction, specifically UMAP, by implementing a locally linear (but globally nonlinear) embedding function. This allows for the exact quantification of feature attributions for each data point in the UMAP embedding space, directly quantifying the contribution of individual genes to cell positions for scRNAseq data. This stands in contrast to conventional methods like differential expression, which provide only a proxy for what UMAP has learned.</p>
