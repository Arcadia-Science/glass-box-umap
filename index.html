<p>UMAP is a ubiquitous tool for low-dimensional visualization of high-dimensional datasets. UMAP learns a low-dimensional mapping from nearest-neighbor graph structures of datasets, often producing visually interpretable clusters of data that match known labels (e.g., cell type). This is possible because the mapping is highly nonlinear with respect to the input features values, giving it the expressive power needed to form distinct clusters. While the learned relationship between the input features and the embedding positions is often useful, the same nonlinearity that enables clean clusters also makes it difficult to directly interpret the mapping in terms of the input features.</p>
<p>Here, we show how to enable interpretation of the mapping through an alternative implementation of the parametric UMAP algorithm which learns the embedding with a deep network that is locally linear (but globally nonlinear) with respect to the input features. This “glass-box” approach provides a set of exact feature contributions as linear weights that determine the embedding of each data point. By computing the exact feature contribution for each point in a dataset, we can directly quantify which features are responsible for forming each cluster. We explore the feature contributions for a gene expression dataset from the glass-box augmentation of UMAP and compare them with features found by differential expression.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">## Introduction</h2>
<p>UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a powerful tool for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Despite some critical appraisals focused on the use of relative distances over the nonlinear embedding space to generate hypotheses, as well as the “black box” nature of the nonlinear mapping, UMAP remains popular in many fields. Here we present an augmentation to conventional UMAP analysis that generates exact feature attributions for each point in the dataset.</p>
<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is another popular method for dimensionality reduction which finds an alternative linear representation of a dataset by determining a orthogonal directions of maximal variance. Since the principal components that can be used for dimensionality reduction are the linear weights on input feature, this approach was considered to be directly interpretable in feature space.</p>
<p>The recent popularity of the nonlinear UMAP embedding, which is excellent at forming distinctive clusters, came at the cost of interpretable embeddings. Nonlinear methods are generally thought to be black boxes, although there are a range of post-hoc feature attribution methods that provide some measure of interpretability (like differential expression applied for scRNAseq data). UMAP is ubiquitous because of its ability to successfully cluster classes for complex datasets in an unsupervised fashion, in spite of its black-box nature.</p>
<p>UMAP generates distinct clusters as a black box, while PCA provides (sometimes less-distinct) clusters for complex datasets, but also exact feature contributions. What if we could have the best of both approaches? A technique for interpreting nonlinear deep networks [Wang et al., 2016; Mohan et al., 2019] provides the key for bringing exact feature interpretability to UMAP.</p>

<p>At a high level, UMAP emUMAP embeds high-dimensional data into low dimensions by building a nearest-neighbor graph in the original space and learning an embedding in the low-dimensional space that preserves the nearest-neighbor graph according to a loss function.</p>
<p>The extension to a “parametric” form of UMAP (McInnes, 2018 NC), where the low dimensional mapping is learned by a deep network, is a valuable generalization of the embedding approach where new data points can be embedded using the same function,which was not possible with the original version of UMAP. The parametric network is trained using the same loss function (TO DO: show loss function) as the non-parametric model, so this deep network function captures the same relationships as the original non-parametric implementation.</p>
<p>The deep network approach for parametric UMAP is conventionally considered to be somewhat opaque to feature attribution. However, by taking advantage of a growing body of work in this area, we can implement a deep network with a particular architecture that allows us to measure the exact contributions of each input feature.</p>
<p>In the “Extended Data Jacobian Matrix” [Wang et al., 2016] and “Bias-free deep networks…” [Mohan et al., 2019], it is shown that deep networks with zero bias linear layers and certain types of activation functions have exactly equivalent linear representations. Even though these networks are globally nonlinear, which is why deep networks can learn such complex mappings, they are also locally linear for a particular input. These networks fall into the category of homogeneous functions of order 1, which based on Euler’s theorem means a function \(y(x)\) has an equivalent representation with the Jacobian \(J\) which varies as a function of \(x\):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y(x) = J(x) \cdot x\]</span></p>
<p>This is both linear and exact, although the Jacobian must be numerically computed for each input. Linear representations offer a straightforward approach to understanding what the network is doing. At the very least, they are more interpretable than locally nonlinear networks (which includes any deep network with nonzero bias terms in its linear layers).</p>
<p>In today’s GPU rich world, it is straightforward to compute these linear feature contributions for every point in a dataset. These types of deep networks for genomics data are locally linear, and from an interpretability perspective they are effectively globally linear. We easily can perform an exhaustive local analysis, where we compute the Jacobian (via autograd) for every point in a dataset. With globally linear systems, there is only one set of feature weights to analyze, but with locally linear systems, there are as many Jacobians (feature weights) as data points, this becomes an additional step in the analysis.</p>
<p>The exactness of this Jacobian approach is the centerpiece of its appeal. This local analysis is similar to SHAP, LIME and GradCAM, but those are all approximations which could be completely incorrect for the actual nonlinear representation. The Jacobian of a zero-bias ReLU deep network simply weights each feature, quantifying how the globally nonlinear network uses it in the output.</p>
<p>In our case, we apply these deep networks with linear equivalents that exactly reconstruct the output to UMAP. In many papers, UMAP is presented as an interesting representation of data, but is not used much beyond that. In the conventional approach to defining cell type clusters in the embedding space, differential expression is run on various clusters to show what genes are differentially expressed on average (which is a completely different calculation than anything UMAP has done), and cell types are assigned based on those genes. In contrast, with fully interpretable “glass-box” networks, we can compute the exact contribution of each gene to the position of every single cell shown in the UMAP embedding space. Now, the exact gene feature contributions can be directly pulled from the nonlinear UMAP function, instead of from differential expression acting as a proxy for what UMAP learned. Additionally, the Jacobian approach works equally as well for image or protein embedding representations as scRNAseq data, where tools like differential expression are not available.</p>
<p>Beyond the feature attributions for each point, these can be aggregated over categories (like Leiden cluster or cell type) in order to generate hypotheses about the gene features connected to higher-level phenotypes represented in the dataset. This can be done in a straightforward manner by conditioning the feature attribution calculations on a given cell type (or Leiden cluster) and measuring summary statistics, like the mean or the SVD of the feature contributions.</p>
<p>The use of glass box deep networks for UMAP therefore provides clarity into what the embedding function has actually learned.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fitting-the-data-with-the-umap-pytorch-toolbox">Fitting the data with the UMAP PyTorch toolbox</h2>
<p>We use the UMAP PyTorch toolbox to learn an embedding. This fit uses the same loss as the non-parametric version of UMAP. We found that setting the “repulsion strength” parameter to 3.0 (up from 1.0) helped the embeddings learned in PyTorch to better match the embeddings from non-parametric UMAP fits. This parameter effectively controls how far clusters in the embedding space move away from each other, and higher values keep the clusters closer together.</p>

Figure&nbsp;1: The conventional ScanPy UMAP and the PyTorch network UMAP. While they are not exactly the same, note the overall similarities.

<p>We can visualize the embedding and add the top gene contributors to the embedding position as information in the hovertip. As an alternative visualization, we can color the embedding by the largest gene contributor. In some cases, a given cell type label will have different regions where different genes make the largest contribution, like for Reticulocytes, which have several sub regions where the strongest contributors are HBD and HBA2, but the sub region with HBD as the largest gene contributor also extends to the neighboring Normoblast cluster. The UMAP embedding is placing these points near each other because the HBD activity is similar (and correlations with other features are distinctive).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-labels-by-gene">### Feature labels by gene</h2>
<p>We can also generate these plots on average over each class. With 8 separate UMAP fits at different random initializations, we provide the standard error of the normalized mean contribution of each feature. The feature contributions are normalized by the mean embedding distance of the class for a given fit, since in one fit a class could be class to the origin, and far away from the origin in another.</p>
<p>Note that the largest feature contributors do not always point in the direction of the centroid. This gives rise to a gradient of contribution across a cluster. For example, in the reticulocyte cluster, cells embedded with a more negative UMAP 2 coordinate have higher contributions from HBD and HBM, while cells with a more negative UMAP 1 coordinate have higher HBA2, HBA1 and HBB contributions.</p>

Figure&nbsp;5: The top gene features for each cell type. Note that the largest feature vectors do not always point to the centroid, often indicating a gradient of importance for that feature across the cluster. Error bars are generated by normalizing the feature importance vectors for each cell by the distance to the centroid of the class for that UMAP fit to account for changing cluster centroids across fits. Note that most classes have only a few top features.

<p>We can compare the features found by the Jacobian to differential expression.</p>
<p>we find that many of the features found by differential expression between cell types are not preserved in the Jacobian representation. This highlights how the Jacobian method provides a complementary view of the feature space to features from differential expression.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">## Conclusion</h2>
<p>This work demonstrates a novel approach to interpreting UMAP embeddings by leveraging glass box deep networks. We’ve shown how to overcome the traditional black box nature of nonlinear dimensionality reduction, specifically UMAP, by implementing a locally linear (but globally nonlinear) embedding function. This allows for the exact quantification of feature attributions for each data point in the UMAP embedding space, directly quantifying the contribution of individual genes to cell positions for scRNAseq data. This stands in contrast to conventional methods like differential expression, which provide only a proxy for what UMAP has learned.</p>
